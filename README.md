# Othello3D

High School project, done in early 2014, in 3 weeks. The ordered project was to create a web browser Othello game using JavaScript. As I had heard of WebGL and had some time, I decided to make a 3D one !

Test here: http://wwwetu.utc.fr/~hebantma/othello/

# Features:

* Simple 3D engine I made for the project, named Graphic3.js (Now, I would add lighting and optimisation as I learn a lot about OpenGL since this project)
* Local multiplayer (I had started to work on mutiplayer using JS WebSocket but never took the time to finish it)
* Player vs AI (A really poor AI but strong enoutgth to beat the poor othello player I'm ^^. I might upgrade it to a basic minimax algorithm one of these days)
